The "cacheflow" extension provides a cache management solution for TYPO3 CMS, allowing you to flow the pages cache and
keep it up-to-date. It includes a CLI-command that can be executed from the command-line directly as well as be invoked
as Scheduler task. This process aims to ensure that the cache is always up-to-date and delivers the latest content to
your TYPO3 website visitors.
